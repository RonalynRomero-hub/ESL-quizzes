<h1>Tom's School Adventure</h1>
<p id="story">Tom is a new student at school. He smiles warmly and greets his classmates, introducing himself and asking how they are. Everyone responds kindly, which makes him feel welcome and happy. As he walks to his seat, he notices a few students waving at him and offering to help him with his things. He feels a sense of relief knowing that making friends here might be easier than he expected. By the end of the morning, Tom is already looking forward to joining class activities and meeting more of his classmates.</p>
